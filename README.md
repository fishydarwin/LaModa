# LaModă

A fictional website (in Romanian) which lets users post articles of their latest in-fashion clothing, make-up, manicure and so on... Front-end is Angular, and back-end is Java Spring.

This project was originally created for my university class.  
I am actively working on finishing this implementation:
- Front-end/UI Looks ✅
- Mock data ✅
- Validation ✅
- CRUD Operations ✅
- Unit Testing ✅
- User Features 🟡
- Back-end server 🔴
- Back-end 🔴

✅ - done | 🟡 - roughly 50% done | 🔴 - not yet started

## Front-end considerations

The front-end was written with Safari (WebKit) in mind, as I use a MacBook. I have tried to make the SCSS code as portable as possible, though some platforms may see differences. Please open a **new issue** if you encounter any trouble.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
