# LaModÄƒ

A fictional website (in Romanian) which lets users post articles of their latest in-fashion clothing, make-up, manicure and so on... Front-end is Angular, and back-end is Java Spring.

[You must use this alongside its back-end](https://github.com/fishydarwin/LaModaBackend)

This project was originally created for my university class.  
I am actively working on finishing this implementation:
- Front-end/UI Looks âœ…
- Mock data âœ…
- Validation âœ…
- CRUD Operations âœ…
- Unit Testing âœ…
- User Features âœ…
- Back-end server âœ… [Back-end](https://github.com/fishydarwin/LaModaBackend)
- Back-end details âœ…
- Back-end SQL database âœ…
- Back-end User Support ðŸŸ¡
- Security check: no CSRF, no cross-origin, no SQL Injection ðŸ”´

âœ… - done | ðŸŸ¡ - roughly 50% done | ðŸ”´ - not yet started

## Front-end considerations

The front-end was written with Safari (WebKit) in mind, as I use a MacBook. I have tried to make the SCSS code as portable as possible, though some platforms may see differences. Please open a **new issue** if you encounter any trouble.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
